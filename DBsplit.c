/*******************************************************************************************

 *  Split a .db into a set of sub-database blocks for use by the Dazzler:
 *     Divide the database <path>.db conceptually into a series of blocks referable to on the
 *     command line as <path>.1.db, <path>.2.db, ...  If the -x option is set then all reads
 *     less than the given length are ignored, and if the -a option is not set then secondary
 *     reads from a given well are also ignored.  The remaining reads are split amongst the
 *     blocks so that each block is of size -s * 1Mbp except for the last which necessarily
 *     contains a smaller residual.  The default value for -s is 400Mbp because blocks of this
 *     size can be compared by our "overlapper" dalign in roughly 16Gb of memory.  The blocks
 *     are very space efficient in that their sub-index of the master .idx is computed on the
 *     fly when loaded, and the .bps file of base pairs is shared with the master DB.  Any
 *     tracks associated with the DB are also computed on the fly when loading a database block.
